 - For the month of August in 2019 there were over 2.3 million rides throug the New York Citibike ridesharing service.
 - Of those 2.3 million rides approximately 81% were done by customers that are subscribed to the service 
 - Approximately 65% of riders were male, 25% were female, and 10% were unknown.
 - Most of the rides were initiated in touristy areas and in downtown manhattan

 - The busiest times for the service are on Monday, Tuesdays, and Thursdays from 5 to 7 PM where Citibike averages around 40,000 riders.

 - As seen from the chart above the bikes are typically checked out for an average of 4 to 6 hours.

 - Males are the dominant users of the service with around 3 times the rides of other users.
 - The rental times for the service follow the same pattern for all genders.

 - Subscribers use the service 10 times more than regular customers.
 - The most rentals are done by subscribers on Monday, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays.

- Weekend rides are the highest from 12 to 4 PM in the afternoon.

- As seen from above the service is least used int he early morning hours of 2 - 4 AM so this would be the time that maintenance would be performed on the bicycles.

## Summary
The data seen above shows that the Citibike ridesharing service has a high amount of demand with the month of August alone getting over 2.3 million riders. The majority of rides were taken by male subscribers in the morning hours and evening rush hours. It would be a reasonable guess to say that the weekday rides would be customers going to work or coming home from work. With New York being known for its subway system, this data shows that Citibike is consistently being used as an alternative form of public transportation.

### Future Analysis
1.) It would be interesting to include other months in this analysis. Since it gets cold in the winter months in New York it would be interesting to see if the amount of riders drops off in the winter months before picking back up in the spring.

2.) Comparing with other competing ride sharing services to see if the competition is keeping draining riders away from Citibike or if Citibike is able to consistenly grow.
